In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be replaced with an enforceable provision which most closely achieves the effect of the original provision, and the remaining terms of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. Nothing in these Terms creates any agency, employment, joint venture, or partnership relationship between you and the Company or enables you to act on behalf of the Company. Except as may be expressly stated in these Terms, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between the Company and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof.</br>

You expressly agree to the receipt of such communications and notices in such manner.</br>
                                You may not assign any rights hereunder without our prior written consent. Nothing contained in these Terms shall be construed to limit the actions or remedies available to the Company with respect to any prohibited activity or conduct. Non-enforcement of any term of these Terms does not constitute consent or waiver, and the Company reserves the right to enforce such term at its sole discretion. No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.</p>
