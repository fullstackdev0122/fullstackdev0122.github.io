										<h4 class="h3 question">What is Bitcoin profit?</h4>
										<p class="answer">
											Bitcoin profit is a powerful software that enables traders to earn from trading cryptocurrencies,
											like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The software uses advanced technology, which ensures that you are a
											step ahead of traders using other software. The software's algorithm has a time leap of 0.01
											seconds, an indication that it can anticipate price movements and market shifts more accurately
											than most of the software available in the market. Besides, the robust algorithm built into the
											software enables it to do an in-depth analysis of the market. This laser-accurate analysis affords
											the user profitable trading opportunities more than 99% of the time. The ultimate reward is that
											you can watch your money grow unbridled as long as you spend just 20 everyday minutes setting up
											the trading parameters of the software. That is not all. You can choose to go on full automation
											mode or simply oscillate between automation and manual trading. However, this depends on your
											understanding of the market as well as the level of confidence you have in your ability to read
											the market accurately. Nonetheless, you do not have to disturb your mind with switching to manual
											mode because Bitcoin profit is ideal for all kinds of traders, novice or expert. You will do
											yourself an excellent service if you spend your free time growing your other skills! Full
											automation comes with the most significant advantage of taking the psychological aspect of trading
											away from your activities. It means that your trades will be immune from anxiety attacks that
											might threaten to deny your account maximum profits. Nevertheless, most confident traders can
											leverage the robustness of the software to test their strategies. Also, Bitcoin profit is
											straightforward enabling anyone to trade and profit. This is because its creators, Mike and Jeff,
											do not have a twisted view of the financial markets, or the cryptocurrency markets in particular,
											like that of hardened Wall Street racketeers. Subsequently, the software is ideal for everyday
											people like you who want nothing more than an alternative source for a steady stream of income.

										<h4 class="h3 question">What Is The Withdrawal Process?</h4>
										<p class="answer">
											Simple. We take great care to simplify our processes because we understand what it means for our
											community members to access their funds without a hassle. To commence the withdrawal process, you
											will be required to fill in a form that shows your intention to withdraw funds. You will capture
											your details correctly, as they appeared in the account registration form. Additionally, you will
											state the amount of money that you would like to withdraw. Before submitting the withdrawal
											request form, there will be a prompt for you to input the password to your account. This is to
											ensure that it is the right person making the withdrawal request. On submitting the withdrawal
											request, your broker will address the request in a maximum of 48 hours and a minimum of 24 hours.
											Remember, withdrawal is free of charge! In case you need any assistance, please feel free to reach
											us through the support contacts.
